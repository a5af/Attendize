                    <p class="testimonialtext">After I went to my 1st conference for Mortgage Protection sales, I had my best week out in the field, 20 policies for $30,883 in Simplified Issue Premium. Bill Martin was a huge part of what I learned there. He spent time to coach me through areas that I needed help. You can't do this business on your own. We all need help. </p>

Besides all of the fantastic training we all receive, you have the opportunity to be around the top producers and agency managers in the entire country who will gladly share their insights with you.  I have seen, first hand how immediately following an event like this, an agent's sales volume increases dramatically.  The value on attending conference seems immeasurable.  </p>
